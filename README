NOTES
       Setting the track number, cd number, track total or compiliation to 0 will remove the tag.
       Forcing a file type onto a different file may cause unexpected results.

       Always, ALWAYS use on a backup of the original, just in case!

       Filetypes
       1=FLAC
       2=AAC
       3=MP3
       4=UNKNOWN

       Removing the track tag will alo remove the total tracks tag.
